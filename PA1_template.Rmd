# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r LoadingPreprocessingData,echo=TRUE}
repdata<-read.csv("./activity/activity.csv", header=TRUE)
str(repdata)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r MeanTotal,echo=TRUE}
dailysteps<-tapply(repdata$steps,repdata$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE)
hist(dailysteps,breaks=62,xlab="Total Daily Steps",main = paste("Histogram of Total Daily Steps"),)
```
The mean of daily total number of steps is
```{r ,echo=TRUE}
mean(dailysteps)
```

The median of daily total number of steps is
```{r ,echo=TRUE}
median(dailysteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
